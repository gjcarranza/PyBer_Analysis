# PyBer Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to provide visualizations that showcase the relationship within the following variables: type of city, number of drivers, number of rides, percentage of total drivers, rider, and fares. This analysis provides insight in the for the company's ability to provide access and affordability to under-served neighborhoods

---

# Result
The following image provides the density of drivers within three types of cities: urban, suburban, and rural along with the number of rides given per city and their average fair in $USD.

As a result of the graph above, it is evident that rural areas are severely under-served with higher average fare rates in comparison to urban and suburban areas.

In Graph 1, the graph produces a range for number of rides for each city type. This displays how urban city types are efficiently served by comparison to rural city types however when viewing the graph for Graph 2, rural areas pay more in fare than urban areas. It is evident why fares are high and number or rides are scarce in rural areas as the graph Graph 3 proves that the number of drivers are scarce in rural areas.

In Graph 4, the graph depicts how urban city types carry the majority of total fares in profit and how rural areas are essentially untapped. Reinvesting resources into rural areas to monopolize or equilibrate fare prices amongst city types over time may provide some profit for PyBer. Graphs 5 and 6 provide a better visualization of the correlation between number of rides given per city type and number of drivers available in city types

In this last graph, depicts the amount of fare in $USD earned in between the months of January and April. Despite PyBer earning the majority of profits from urban areas, the company earned little profit from rural areas thus further urgining the company to invest time and energy into prividing more accessible and affordable rideshare in rural areas by installing pick-up/drop-off points in rural areas.

# Summary
By the analysis conducted for the purpose of discorvering the best posssible solution for PyBer and allowing affordability and accessibility in rural areas one of three solutions may be discussed:
1. Advertise for people who are interested in becoming drivers to work for PyBer and provide additional payments and benefits to drivers in rural areas. 
2. Install pick-up/drop-off points in rural areas in more common areas in rural areas such as a local drug store or grocery store to compensate for the distance assigned drivers have
3. Install shuttling service areas that will take them to areas that are more densely populated with readily-available drivers
